## Code Correctness and Quality

- **Prioritize Correctness:** All code generated or modified should be functionally correct and logically sound.
- **Testing:** When adding new features or fixing bugs, also add or update tests to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
- **Adherence to Standards:** Follow existing project conventions, coding styles, and best practices.
- **Validation:** Run linters, type-checkers, and other validation tools available in the project to ensure code quality.
